name: commit-report
description: >-
  Generate a work report tunable to audience (dev / pm / client) and deliver it as a copy-ready channel block or a written doc. Two modes: `quick` (git-only, zero-config — prose + bullets from the current repo) and `standup` (multi-source — GitHub PRs/reviews/comments + git across repos + deploys + optional tracker, framed as an impact narrative). Use when the user asks for a standup, status update, work summary, "what did I ship today", commit recap, end-of-day report, PM/client update, a report to paste into a channel, or a standup doc — or runs /commit-report. Triggers on "write a report", "summarize commits", "standup", "report for the PM", "update for the client", "send a report", "what did I do today/yesterday". Default delivery is a copy-ready block; `--doc` writes the full report to a file; `--metrics` appends flow metrics (human review coverage, rework depth, artifact lag, spec churn, caught-vs-escaped defects, recurring fix classes) derived from git and gh. Quick mode default scope = `--since-mine` (current user's contiguous commit batch at HEAD); standup mode default window = last working day → now. Parses Conventional Commits prefixes and honors Co-Authored-By trailers.

# commit-report

One skill, two modes, two deliveries.

- **Modes** — `quick` (default): git log of the current repo → prose + bullets, zero config. `standup` (`--standup`): multi-source — GitHub PRs/reviews/comments, git across configured repos, deploys, optional tracker → impact narrative.
- **Deliveries** — every run ends with a **copy-ready channel block** (the paste-anywhere "send"). Add `--doc` to also write the full report to a file for bigger-scope handoffs.
- **Audience** — `dev` (tech-heavy) / `pm` (mid) / `client` (no jargon). Applies to both modes and to the channel block.

Guiding principle (both modes): **name work by what it was, not by its ID.** "Fixed the image cache eviction" beats "Merged PR #481." IDs live in refs/footnotes, never in the headline.

## Quick start

```
/commit-report                          # quick mode, dev, --since-mine, prints channel block
/commit-report pm                       # PM-friendly summary of latest batch
/commit-report client --last 4h         # client-safe wording, last 4h
/commit-report dev --count 5            # last 5 commits by user
/commit-report pm --since a3f2c1d       # commits since this hash up to HEAD
/commit-report pm --range main..HEAD    # explicit range
/commit-report dev --path apps/web      # restrict to subdir
/commit-report dev --include-merges     # include merge commits (dev only)

/commit-report --standup                # multi-source standup, last working day → now
/commit-report pm --standup             # standup, PM-framed
/commit-report --standup --repos a,b,c  # override local repo roots for this run
/commit-report pm --standup --doc       # write full report to a doc AND print channel block
/commit-report pm --standup --doc ~/standups/today.md   # explicit doc path

/commit-report --metrics                # append flow metrics for the window
/commit-report dev --metrics --last week
```

Flag precedence: explicit scope flag > mode default window. `--doc`, `--metrics`, and audience compose with any mode.

## Modes

### quick (default)
Git log of the **current repo** only. Zero config. Produces `## Report` (prose) + `## Bullets`, then the channel block. This is the original commit-report behavior — unchanged.

### standup (`--standup` / `--full`)
Multi-source. Requires one-time [config](#first-run-config-standup-only). Produces the full [standup format](#standup-format) (Yesterday / Recap / Today / Channel / Refs), then the channel block. Default window = **last working day → now** (see [Time window](#time-window)).

If `--standup` is requested but config is missing, run [First-run config](#first-run-config-standup-only) first.

## Delivery

Both modes always end by printing the **copy-ready channel block** — a tight, paste-anywhere summary shaped for a chat channel:

```
## For the channel
<one line naming the day's / batch's theme>
- <outcome, not implementation>
- <outcome>
```

Rules for the block: outcome-focused, never a changelog. No SHAs, no file paths, no function names (even at `dev` — the channel block is the compact, human-facing cut). 2–5 bullets. This is the default "send."

`--doc [path]` — additionally write the **full report** (mode-appropriate format) to a Markdown file, for bigger-scope handoffs.
- Default path: `standups/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (relative to cwd). Create the `standups/` dir if it doesn't exist. Override per-run with `--doc <path>`, or set `docDir` in config.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` = the window's end date (today), from a real timestamp (`git log -1 --date=short` or system date) — never invented.
- After writing, print the file path AND the channel block (so the user can both paste and hand off).
- <!-- scope note: doc path is a default, not a law — one config key or one flag overrides it. Deliberately no chat/Slack/email auto-send; a paste-ready block + a file cover "send it" without any external auth. Add a real integration only if the user asks. -->

## First-run config (standup only)

Config lives at `~/.claude/skills/commit-report/config.json`. Quick mode ignores it entirely — never require config for a git-only report.

On first `--standup` run with no config, ask for and persist:

```json
{
  "githubLogin": "octocat",
  "displayName": "Matheus",
  "voice": "first",
  "repoScope": "org:my-org",
  "localRepoRoots": ["C:/Users/malag/projects/work", "C:/Users/malag/projects/side"],
  "tracker": null,
  "docDir": "standups"
}
```

- `githubLogin` — for `gh` searches (`author:`, `reviewed-by:`, `commenter:`).
- `displayName` + `voice` (`first` | `third`) — narrative voice.
- `repoScope` — `org:name`, `user:login`, or an explicit list of `owner/repo`.
- `localRepoRoots` — dirs to scan for local commits (walk one level for git repos).
- `tracker` — optional MCP for ticket titles (e.g. `linear`, `jira`), else `null`.
- `docDir` — default `--doc` directory. `null`/absent → use the delivery default above.

Keep setup to the minimum needed for the flags actually used; don't prompt for a tracker if none is configured and no ticket refs appear.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve mode**: `--standup`/`--full` → standup, else quick.
2. **Resolve identity**: `git config user.email`. In quick mode, bail with a clear error if unset. For author matching, scan both the `--author` field AND `Co-Authored-By:` trailers — pair-programming commits where the user is co-author must be included, not silently dropped.
3. **Resolve audience** (positional first arg, default `dev`): `dev` | `pm` | `client`.
4. **Resolve scope / window**:
   - **quick** (precedence: explicit flag > default `--since-mine`):
     - `--since-mine` *(default)*: contiguous commits at HEAD authored by user. Walk back via `git log --pretty='%H%x09%ae'`; stop at first commit whose author email ≠ user. If HEAD's author ≠ user → fall back to `--last today` and note the fallback in output.
     - `--since <hash>`: `git log <hash>..HEAD --author="$email"`. Hash = exclusive lower bound. Short or full SHA.
     - `--last <duration>`: `1h`, `4h`, `today`, `week` → `git log --author="$email" --since=<duration>`.
     - `--count <n>`: `git log --author="$email" -n <n>`.
     - `--range <ref..ref>`: `git log --author="$email" <range>`.
     - `--path <dir>`: append `-- <dir>` to any `git log`. Repo cwd is default.
   - **standup**: default window = [last working day → now](#time-window). Any explicit quick-scope flag overrides the window.
5. **Collect data**:
   - **quick** — per commit: subject, body, short SHA, files changed (`git show --stat --pretty=format:'%h%n%H%n%s%n%b' <sha>`). Skip merge commits unless `dev` + `--include-merges`.
   - **standup** — run these in parallel (see [Multi-source collection](#multi-source-collection-standup)).
6. **Parse Conventional Commits prefixes** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`) as the primary bucketing signal: features ship, fixes resolve, refactor/chore/test = "groundwork" for client audience. No prefix → content heuristics. Scope in parens (`feat(auth):`) is a `pm`/`client` framing hint.
7. **Synthesize** per audience + mode ([Audience map](#audience-map), [Standup format](#standup-format)). Group related work; do not echo subjects 1:1. Name by outcome, not ID.
8. **Deliver**: render the mode's format, then always the channel block. If `--metrics`, insert the [flow-metrics](#flow-metrics---metrics) section before the channel block. If `--doc`, write the full report to file and print its path.

## Multi-source collection (standup)

Query in parallel, then merge and dedupe:

1. **Authored PRs** — `gh search prs --author={githubLogin} --merged` (and open/draft for Today) within the window, scoped by `repoScope`.
2. **Reviews given** — `gh search prs --reviewed-by={githubLogin}` in the window.
3. **Comments left** — `gh search issues --commenter={githubLogin}`, deduped against 1–2.
4. **Local commits** — `git log --author="$email" --since=<window> --date=format:'%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` across each `localRepoRoots` entry (and its child repos). Use the real weekday from the timestamp; never infer it.
5. **Deploys** — release/deploy workflow runs after merge, matched by SHA or time proximity (`gh run list`). Note success/failure.
6. **Linked tickets** — extract Linear/Jira/etc. refs from PR titles/bodies; resolve titles via the `tracker` MCP if configured. If no tracker, keep the raw ref.
7. **Today's queue** — carry-overs (open/draft PRs, unpushed branches), pending review requests (`review-requested:{githubLogin}`), assigned tickets by priority. Cap at 5.

Any source that errors or is unconfigured is skipped silently — a partial report beats a failed one. Note in the report which sources were unavailable only if it materially changes the picture.

## Flow metrics (`--metrics`)

Opt-in. Appends a `## Flow metrics` section measuring **how the work moved**, not what shipped. `dev` audience only — these are engineering-process numbers; a PM or client report gets the outcomes, not the pipeline telemetry. If `--metrics` is combined with `pm`/`client`, compute it into the `--doc` body but keep it out of the channel block.

Every figure below is derived from git and `gh` alone — no new tooling, no instrumentation to install. That also means several are **proxies**, and a proxy reported as a fact is worse than no metric. Label them as marked, and when the window is too small for a number to mean anything (fewer than ~5 PRs), print the raw counts and skip the percentage rather than reporting "100% first-pass" off a sample of one.

**Leading** — cheap signals that move before quality does:

| Metric | How to derive | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Review coverage** | Report it **three ways**: PRs with a human review, PRs with a bot review, PRs with neither. Filter on `.user.type=="User"` vs `"Bot"` — see [automated-reviewers](../review-pass/references/automated-reviewers.md) | Compute this **first** — it calibrates everything below |
| Rework signal | inline review comments per PR (`repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments`), median and worst. Where review coverage is high, also count commits pushed after the first review's `submittedAt` | The real "had to redo work" signal |
| First-pass merge rate | merged PRs with no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` ÷ all merged PRs — **but only report it when review coverage is meaningful and the state is actually in use** | See the trap below |

**The `CHANGES_REQUESTED` trap.** Plenty of teams review thoroughly and never touch that button; they approve and leave inline comments instead. On such a repo this metric reports a flawless 100% that means nothing, and it reports the same 100% for a repo that merges entirely unreviewed. Two opposite realities, one flattering number.

So: if zero PRs in the window carry a `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, do **not** print a first-pass rate. Print `not computable — team does not use the CHANGES_REQUESTED state` and lead with review coverage instead. Before blaming the data, confirm `gh` is returning reviews at all by spot-checking one PR you know was approved (`gh pr view <n> --json reviews`) — an empty array everywhere can mean a broken query rather than an unreviewed repo, and those need opposite responses.

**Never filter bots by login suffix.** Use `.user.type`. GitHub Copilot files its review under `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` but authors its inline comments as plain `Copilot`, which sails through a suffix check and gets counted as a person. That single mistake turned a real 9/25 human-review figure into a reassuring 21/25 on a repo whose review gap was the finding. `user.type` is `"Bot"` for both identities.

```bash
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$N/comments" -q '[.[] | select(.user.type=="User")] | length'
```

Bot review is worth counting — separately, never folded into the human number. A repo where bots review everything and humans review little is a different situation from one with no review at all, and both differ from thorough human review; one figure cannot say which you're looking at. Deploy bots (`vercel[bot]`, `cloudflare-workers-and-pages[bot]`) are not reviewers at all and belong in neither column.

If a configured reviewer is paused, absent, or stale, give it a line. An automated reviewer reporting *"reviews are paused for this user"* on the repo with the highest fix share is a finding, not a footnote.
| Stage-artifact lag | `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%aI` over `docs/intent/`, `docs/prds/`, `docs/plans/`, then the first code commit citing that slug. Report the gaps | Measures the dev-flow chain itself; only meaningful on repos that use it |

**Lagging** — the ones that actually tell you whether the process is working:

| Metric | How to derive | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Spec churn after build | commits touching `docs/prds/NNNN-<slug>.md` dated **after** the first code commit for that slug | Proxy. High churn means to-prd ran on thin context |
| Caught vs escaped | `fix:` commits on a branch **before** its PR merged (caught) vs `fix:` commits landing after a merge that touch files the merge introduced (escaped) | Proxy, and the softest one — conventional-commit discipline is the only signal available. Say so |
| Repeat classes | run `sentinel`'s scanner — `py -3 ~/.claude/skills/sentinel/scripts/scan_git_signals.py --repo . --since <window>` — and report its `recurring` bucket | Proxy for "same incident twice". Don't hand-roll this: a raw fix-count ranking is dominated by locale catalogs and same-day iteration, which is why that scanner buckets against the repo's own distribution. A file recurring three windows running is the finding, not the count |

Output shape:

```
## Flow metrics
- Review coverage: human 9/25, bot 25/25, unreviewed 0/25
- Rework: median 3 inline comments/PR, worst #482 at 11
- First-pass merge: not computable — no PR used CHANGES_REQUESTED this window
- Artifact lag: intent → PRD 2h, PRD → plan 1d, plan → first commit 3h
- Spec churn after build: 1 PRD amended post-code (#0012 payments-retry)
- Caught vs escaped [proxy]: fix share 0.09, 0 reverts
- Repeat classes [proxy]: `src/api/orders.ts` 8x over 19d (sentinel, recurring)
```

Rules: never invent a figure to fill a row — drop the row and say which data was unavailable. Never present a proxy without its `[proxy]` tag. Trend beats level; a single window's number is close to meaningless, so when prior `--doc` reports exist in `docDir`, read the last one and show the delta.

## Time window

Used by standup mode (quick mode uses its scope flags). "Yesterday" = **last working day**, window ends **now** (captures work done earlier today):

- Monday → previous Friday 00:00
- Tue–Fri → previous calendar day 00:00
- Sat/Sun → most recent Friday 00:00

Every temporal claim must trace to a real timestamp from git / GitHub / MCP. Never invent a weekday or time.

## Audience map

| Concept                    | dev                                                     | pm                                              | client                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `useEffect` cleanup leak   | "fixed memory leak in `useEffect` cleanup on Dashboard" | "fixed memory leak in dashboard"                | "dashboard runs smoother"           |
| DB index added             | "added btree index on `orders.user_id`"                 | "sped up order lookups"                         | "orders load faster"                |
| Pure refactor, no UX delta | "extracted `AuthGuard` HOC, dedup in 4 routes"          | "cleaned up auth code for maintainability"      | "ongoing improvements to keep things stable" |
| Auth bug                   | "fixed JWT expiry off-by-one in `validateToken`"        | "fixed login bug where sessions expired early"  | "login is more reliable"            |
| New endpoint               | "added `POST /api/exports` with stream response"        | "shipped exports endpoint for the export flow"  | "you can now export your data"      |

Rules per level:

- **dev**: backticks for files/functions/symbols. Short SHAs in parens, e.g. `(a3f2c1d)`. May mention internals. *(Not the channel block — see Delivery.)*
- **pm**: no SHAs, no file paths, no function names. Frame as features / fixes / improvements / cleanup. Light tech terms OK ("API", "auth flow", "caching").
- **client**: outcomes only. No tech terms, no internal names. Include every commit — frame refactor/chore/test work as softened reliability/stability statements ("ongoing improvements", "behind-the-scenes work to keep things stable", "groundwork for upcoming features"). Never drop commits silently.

## Output formats

### quick format
```
## Report
<prose, level-appropriate. dev ≈ 2 short paragraphs; pm ≈ 1 paragraph (~120 words); client ≈ 1 paragraph (~80 words)>

## Bullets
- <shipped change, verb-first, level-vocab>   (5–8 items; 1–2 for a single commit)

## For the channel
<theme line>
- <outcome>
```

### standup format
```
# Standup: {DATE}
> Covering: {WINDOW} | {COUNTS}

## Yesterday
<2–3 sentence impact paragraph — what changed about the system, who's unblocked, what risk surfaced>

## Recap
<2–5 paragraphs, grouped by work thread (not by source). Lead with system impact, name root causes, reframe reviews as judgment calls, say what didn't ship and why. Vary sentence openings.>

## Today
<carry-overs → pending reviews → queue; capped at 5>

## For the channel
<theme line>
- <outcome>

## Refs
<footnote: ticket IDs and PR links>
```

The channel block is the only part printed when neither a doc nor the full body is wanted — but by default print the full mode format followed by the channel block. `--doc` writes the full body to file; the channel block is still printed to chat.

## Edge cases

- **No commits / no activity in window** → say so plainly ("quiet day, nothing landed in code" beats fabricated activity); suggest widening (`--last today`, `--last week`, or `--standup` for cross-repo work).
- **quick `--since-mine` + HEAD not user's** → fall back to `--last today`, prepend: *"HEAD not authored by you — showing today's commits instead."*
- **Mixed merge commits** → skip by default; include only with `dev --include-merges`.
- **Single commit** → still produce Report + Bullets + channel block (Bullets may be 1–2 items).
- **Repo not initialized / outside repo** → quick mode bails with a clear error; standup mode can still run from `localRepoRoots` + GitHub if configured.
- **standup with missing config** → run first-run setup, don't guess.
- **A standup source errors** → skip it silently; a partial report beats a failure.
- **Commit body / PR body contains secrets/tokens** → surface only subject + summarized intent, never raw body.
- **`--doc` target dir doesn't exist** → create it, then write.

## Output rules

- Every run ends with the `## For the channel` block. In quick and standup mode the full format precedes it.
- Channel block is outcome-only: no SHAs, no file paths, no function names, at any audience.
- No emoji.
- Code/file refs in backticks at `dev` only, and never in the channel block.
- No commit hashes in `pm` / `client`.
- Never invent timestamps, weekdays, or activity. Every claim traces to real data.
- Caveman mode does NOT apply to report content — write normal prose. Commands/code stay verbatim.

## Humanize the written prose (if available)

Before writing generated prose to a file (`--doc`), if the `humanizer` skill is installed, run it on the drafted body so the document reads naturally and free of AI tells; skip silently if unavailable. Apply to the human-facing document body only — never to code, frontmatter, file paths, IDs, or literal templates.
