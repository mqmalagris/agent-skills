name: to-prd
description: Turn the current conversation context into a PRD and publish it to GitHub Issues, also persisting it to docs/prds/NNNN-<slug>.md for downstream skills (heist, maestro). Use when user wants to create a PRD from the current context. Triggers on /to-prd, "write a PRD", "draft a PRD", "spec this out", "feature spec", or after /grill-me when scope and Glossary are settled.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a PRD. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know. If context is too thin to synthesize, halt and tell the user to run `/grill-me` first; don't fabricate scope.

## Process

1. **Read the codebase.** Explore the repo to understand current state if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary throughout the PRD.

2. **Scan `docs/adr/`** for accepted ADRs touching the area. List relevant ones in a `Sources` line and respect their locked decisions. If the PRD's scope would violate an ADR, surface the conflict to the user before writing.

3. **Pick the Glossary source** (in priority order):
   1. Glossary block emitted by a prior `/grill-me` session in the conversation.
   2. Domain terms already used in the codebase — search for prominent nouns/verbs in module names, types, and route names.
   3. Terms surfaced in the conversation context.

4. **Sketch the major modules** to build or modify. Actively look for opportunities to extract deep modules — ones that encapsulate substantial functionality behind a simple, testable, slow-to-change interface (Ousterhout). Do not interview; synthesize from context. If module shape is unclear, halt and route back to `/grill-me`.

5. **Write the PRD** following [PRD-TEMPLATE.md](PRD-TEMPLATE.md), to two destinations:
   - **Disk**: get the target path from `bash scripts/next-prd-index.sh <slug>` (prints the zero-padded next-index path, creates `docs/prds/` if missing), then write the filled template there. This is what `heist` and `maestro` consume.
   - **Tracker**: `bash scripts/publish-prd.sh <prd-file> "<title>"` — opens a GitHub issue with the `needs-triage` label, auto-falling back (drop the label, or skip the tracker entirely) and warning to stderr when the label is missing, `gh` is unconfigured/unauthed, or the repo isn't on GitHub.

## Rules

- **No interviewing.** Pure synthesis. Halt to `/grill-me` if context is too thin.
- **Glossary is load-bearing.** Heist and the implementing code must use the same terms verbatim.
- **Respect ADRs.** Locked architectural decisions are inputs, not topics to relitigate.
- **Update existing PRD** if user says "update the PRD" — find by slug. Edit-safe sections: `Status`, `Further Notes`, adding new `User Stories` or `Implementation Decisions` entries, expanding `Out of Scope`. Locked sections (require explicit user OK): `Problem Statement`, `Solution`, `Glossary`, `Sources`. Never silently drop user stories — mark as `(removed: <reason>)` instead.

## When to skip to-prd

- Bug fix (just fix it; commit message is enough).
- Single-file change.
- Spike/throwaway.
- PRD already exists and feature scope hasn't changed.
- Pure refactor with no user-visible change (use an ADR via `/compass` instead).

## Pipeline placement

`grill-me → to-prd → compass → heist → maestro → code`

- **grill-me** extracts scope, design-tree decisions, and Glossary via interview.
- **to-prd** (this skill) synthesizes the above into a PRD on disk + tracker.
- **compass** locks architectural decisions in ADRs (auto-written to `docs/adr/`).
- **heist** consumes PRD + ADRs, produces implementation plan at `docs/plans/NNNN-<slug>.md`.
- **maestro** verifies parallel feasibility across N plans, orchestrates agents in git worktrees.
- **code** — user or agent implements one phase at a time.

Skip earlier stages when the artifact already exists. If grill-me hasn't run and the conversation lacks scope clarity, halt and route there instead of synthesizing fiction.
