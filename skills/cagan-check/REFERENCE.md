## The 5 Risks (Cagan's 4 + Torres' Ethical)

Every feature carries 5 risks. Discovery exists to attack the unvalidated ones **before** delivery. Cagan defines the first 4; Teresa Torres expands the set to include Ethical, increasingly critical in the AI/LGPD/GDPR era.

### 1. Value risk
**Question**: Will the customer use/buy it?

Validation: interviews, prototype tested with real users, in-production A/B, usage data from analogous features.

Signs it's NOT validated: "we think they'll like it", "client asked for it" (≠ client will use it), "competitor has it".

### 2. Usability risk
**Question**: Can the customer discover and use it?

Validation: usability testing with a prototype, observed sessions, funnel metrics from similar features.

Signs it's NOT validated: never tested outside the team, copy written by dev/PM with no review, >5-step flow never tested.

### 3. Feasibility risk
**Question**: Can engineering build it with the time/skill/tech available?

Validation: technical spike, proof of concept, tech lead consultation, load analysis.

Signs it's NOT validated: new tech with no POC, integration with unknown system, scale assumed without test, external deps unconfirmed.

**This risk is your superpower as a dev.** You're the only one who can answer honestly. Raise it early.

### 4. Business Viability risk
**Question**: Does it work for the rest of the business (legal, finance, sales, marketing, support, compliance)?

Validation: stakeholder review early, not at the end.

Signs it's NOT validated: LGPD/GDPR not checked, infra cost not calculated, support not trained, client contract doesn't cover it, marketing doesn't know how to sell.

**In agency settings**: the client contract IS viability. A feature outside scope = high risk even if the client wants it.

### 5. Ethical risk (Torres)
**Question**: Should we build it? Who gets harmed?

Validation: bias/fairness review, impact analysis on vulnerable groups, legal consult (LGPD/GDPR), dark-pattern audit of the flow.

Signs it's NOT validated: AI feature with no bias review, data collection with no clear purpose, UX patterns that pressure the user (fake scarcity, forced continuity, confirmshaming).

**In the AI era**: Cagan (2025) notes that the design of programmatic interfaces (APIs, agents) is driven by the tech lead, not the designer. You (dev) carry this risk on AI features. Ask: does the agent deceive the user? Does an automated decision have a human appeal path?

## Direct quotes (Cagan / SVPG)

> "Engineers are often the best source of innovation, as they know what is possible."

Reinforces: a dev in discovery isn't a courtesy — they're the primary source of viable ideas.

> "Empowered engineers are the single most important thing for being a great product organization."

Reinforces: strong-dev role > strong-PM role in Cagan's hierarchy.

> "Getting the engineer's perspective earlier not only saves wasted time, but also tends to improve the solution itself."

Direct argument for entering discovery early, not waiting for a finished spec.

> "Teams of missionaries are engaged, motivated, have deep understanding of business context, and tangible empathy for the customer. Mercenaries feel no real sense of empowerment or accountability, no passion for the problem to be solved."

Lens for diagnosing your own team.

## Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)

Visual structure for continuous discovery. Use at feature kickoff or quarterly planning.

```
                Outcome (1)
                    |
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
   Opportunity  Opportunity  Opportunity   ← user problems/pains
        |             |             |
    ┌───┴───┐         |         ┌───┴───┐
  Solution Solution  Solution Solution      ← candidate ideas
        |             |             |
   Assumption  Assumption    Assumption     ← experiments to validate
     test         test          test
```

Rules:
- **One outcome per tree** (don't turn it into a feature backlog)
- **Opportunities = problems**, not solutions
- **Solutions are candidates** — most will be killed
- **Assumptions = what must be true** for the solution to work — test cheaply before coding

Dev's role on the OST:
- Surfaces technically viable solutions PM/designer can't see
- Identifies **feasibility** assumptions (load, latency, integration) — proposes a spike
- Kills tree branches when an assumption fails

## Transformed — 3 axes of change (Cagan 2024)

When assessing the product maturity of a company/client, separate it into 3:

1. **How you build** (delivery) — CI/CD, quality, automation
2. **How you solve problems** (discovery) — prototypes, validation, customer touch
3. **How you decide which problems to solve** (strategy) — vision, insights, focus

**Diagnostic shortcut**: a company that has only evolved #1 is still a feature factory. Real transformation requires all 3.

**In agency settings (Arctic Leaf)**: the client usually pays for #1 (delivery). Pushing toward #2 (discovery sprint) and #3 (problem before feature) is the commercial challenge. Use this lens to propose different scopes in proposals.

## Feature Factory Smells (catalogue)

Adapted from John Cutler ("12 Signs You're Working in a Feature Factory") + Cagan.

### Process symptoms
- 🔴 Roadmap = list of features with dates, no outcome
- 🔴 Success measured by "we shipped on time", not by impact
- 🔴 No instrumentation on what shipped
- 🔴 We never kill features even when nobody uses them
- 🔴 **High WIP** (Cutler 2025 update) — many items in parallel. "Optimizing to keep people busy" is the core of the feature factory
- 🔴 **Team Tetris** — teams shuffled rapidly between projects, no lasting mission
- 🔴 **Success theater** — celebrating "shipping" without discussing real impact
- 🟡 Data used as a "trust proxy" to control the team, not to learn

### Role symptoms
- 🔴 PM acts as a project manager (manages tickets, not the problem)
- 🔴 Designer only does the final mockup, doesn't participate in discovery
- 🔴 Eng receives a finished ticket, has no voice in the solution
- 🔴 No "trio" — roles work sequentially, not together

### Customer symptoms
- 🔴 The team never talks to the end user
- 🟡 Team talks only to internal stakeholders (not users)
- 🟡 Research outsourced to a separate "user research team"

### Discovery symptoms
- 🔴 No discovery phase — only delivery
- 🔴 Prototype = "nice screen for approval", not validation
- 🟡 Discovery exists but is "design done before dev"

### Agency symptoms (Arctic Leaf)
- 🟡 Client hands over a finished backlog, team only executes
- 🟡 Project success = client signs off, not end user adoption
- 🟡 No access to the client's product metrics

### Prerequisites to escape the feature factory (Cutler 2025)
- **Trust + psychological safety** — not a consequence, a **prerequisite**. Without psychological safety, the team won't surface problems, won't experiment, won't kill bad features. A leader who punishes error kills empowered teams before they're born.
- **Collaborative decision reviews** — not adversarial, not used to rank teams
- **Shared language of value** — without it nobody agrees on what matters
- **12–18 months of practice** — transformation is gradual. "Chipping away" works better than all-or-nothing. In agency settings, start with one pilot project.

## Prototype types (Cagan — 4 types)

When to suggest a spike vs full implementation.

In *Inspired*, Cagan defines **4 types** — not 3, not 5. Wizard of Oz is a subtype of hybrid, not a separate type (common mistake).

### 1. Feasibility prototype
**When**: new tech, unknown integration, performance/scale doubt
**Form**: technical spike, 1–3 days, throwaway code — "just enough code" to prove it works
**Dev does**: yes, exclusive eng task

### 2. User prototype (hi-fi)
**When**: testing flow and usability
**Form**: interactive Figma or mocked front-end
**Dev does**: sometimes, designer usually leads

### 3. Live-data prototype
**When**: needs testing with real users but the full back-end doesn't exist yet
**Form**: reduced functional version — doesn't scale, no SEO/analytics, but works with real data
**Dev does**: real frontend + minimal back-end

### 4. Hybrid prototype
**When**: validating demand/behavior before investing in real automation
**Form**: combination of real and simulated parts
**Classic subtype — Wizard of Oz**: a human manually does behind the scenes what the system will automate later. The front looks like a real product.
**Dev does**: minimal interface + tooling for the human operator

**Choice rule**:
- Technical doubt → **feasibility**
- Flow/UX doubt → **user**
- Value doubt with real data → **live-data**
- Demand doubt before coding automation → **hybrid (Wizard of Oz)**

## Team typology (Inspired)

| Type | Receives | Decides | Result |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Delivery team | Ticket | Nothing | Output |
| Feature team | Feature spec | How to code it | Output |
| **Product team (empowered)** | Problem + context | Complete solution | Outcome |

Cagan: only product teams innovate. The rest execute.

**As a dev**: identify which type you're in. If feature/delivery, use cagan-check to pull toward the product side.

## Cagan-style questions (use in meetings)

Drop into the call without sounding arrogant:

1. "What user problem does this solve?"
2. "How will we know it worked? Which metric will move?"
3. "Have we validated that the user wants this? How?"
4. "Is there a technical risk here we haven't attacked yet?"
5. "Does a spike/prototype before estimating make sense?"
6. "When was the last time the team talked to a real user?"
7. "If we ship this and nobody uses it, what did we learn?"

One per meeting is enough at first. Don't fire a machine gun.

## Torres rule — user interviews

**Past behavior > hypothetical**. Drop into the interview:

✅ **Do** (generates real signal):
- "Tell me about the last time you had to do X"
- "How do you do this today?"
- "What happened next?"
- "Why did you pick that path?"

❌ **Avoid** (generates false yes):
- "Would you use a feature that does Y?"
- "Would you pay for Z?"
- "What would you think of...?"
- Any hypothetical/speculative question

**Why**: users are terrible at predicting their own future behavior but reasonably good at recounting concrete past behavior. Stories reveal context, frustration, workarounds — the basis for design.

**Cadence (Torres' keystone habit)**: the whole team (trio) interviews **at least 1 user per week**. Without this, discovery is theater.
