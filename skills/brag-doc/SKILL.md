name: brag-doc
description: Maintain a monthly brag document (accomplishment log) and roll it up into a promo packet, self-review, or CV material. Blends Lucas Faria's 4-field monthly template with Julia Evans' impact-first categories. Use when the user wants to log what they shipped, prep for a performance or promotion cycle, write a self-review, remember work from months ago, feed achievements to cv-craft, or runs /brag-doc. Modes: draft, example, review, compile. Targets: al (Arctic Leaf employment), side (public / side-project work).

# Brag Doc

Two living docs the user maintains:
- `projects/side/brag/arctic-leaf.md` — employment (Arctic Leaf, agency). For perf/promo cycles; shared with the manager.
- `projects/side/brag/side-projects.md` — public work (OSS, content, shipped apps). Feeds the 2026 job search and cv-craft.

Invocation: `/brag-doc <mode> [target]`. `target` is `al` or `side` — ask if the mode needs one and it's unclear. (Personal skills take space-separated args, so `/brag-doc draft al`, not `:draft`.)

## Modes

### draft
Add this month's entry to the target doc. **Pull real signal first — never invent accomplishments.**
1. Gather evidence: `git log --author=<user> --since="1 month ago"`, recent PRs/tickets, this conversation, and for `side` the career plan at `projects/side/career-plan-90d.md`.
2. Fill the monthly template (see [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)) — four fields: shipped+impact, challenges, "would be much better if", next-month focus.
3. **Impact rule (Julia):** state it *exactly as good as it is* — no inflation, no hedging. Every "shipped" line names an outcome (who uses it, metric, $, time saved), not a task. For fuzzy work: goal → actions taken → observable effect. Mark any unverified number `[ESTIMADO]`.
4. Prepend the entry under a `## <Month Year>` header. Never overwrite past months.

### example
Show a filled monthly entry so the user sees the shape and bar. Read [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md), display it, then offer to turn it into a real draft for their chosen target.

### review
Sharpen an existing entry the user points at. Line by line: task or impact? vague or specific? number or hand-wave? inflated or honest? Rewrite task→impact, flag unsupported claims, cut anything that oversells. Report the diffs and reasons — don't silently edit.

### compile
Roll N monthly entries into one output. Ask which and the date range, then produce:
- `promo` → promo packet / self-review organized by Julia's full categories (projects & impact, collaboration & mentorship, design & docs, company building, what I learned, outside of work).
- `cv` → hand the impact bullets to **cv-craft** as achievement source material.

## Method & sources
- **Lucas Faria** — monthly cadence (first of the month), the 4 fields, the "would be much better if…" unblock field, and *share it with your manager and ask for feedback on what's written* (makes their perf-review job easier, anchors the conversation on what happened).
- **Julia Evans** — impact over tasks, the category taxonomy, "make it sound exactly as good as it is", and that a running doc beats memory six months later. Original: https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/

## Cadence
Monthly. For `al`, share with the manager after each entry. For `side`, the log is CV/portfolio source — keep it publishable.
